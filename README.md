# Advent of code 2017

My solutions for the 2017 [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

## Add a solution (e.g for day 1)

- Download the input into the `inputs/day1.txt` file
- Create a solver into `lib/aoc/day1` named `Aoc.Day1`
- Make the solver implement a `solve/1` method. Itwill be given the input lines as an input
- Run it with the command `mix solve day1`
